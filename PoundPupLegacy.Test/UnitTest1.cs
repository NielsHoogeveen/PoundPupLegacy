        The test here is about http://www.thenewyorker.com/jekgewrg?hewjkgh embedding a url.
        Where is obvious what we want to achieve.
        With a line ending in  http://www.thenewyorker.com/jekgewrg?hewjkgh
        And finally a closing url
        http://www.thenewyorker.com/jekgewrg?hewjkgh
        """;
